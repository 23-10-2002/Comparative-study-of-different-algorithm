Various machine learning algorithms were applied to determine four different severity levels of anxiety. Data was collected using a standard questionnaire i.e., TMAS. Subsequently six different classification techniques were applied – namely Naïve Bayes, KNN, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest Tree. Also, GridSearchCV, K-fold cross validation, two techniques of boosting – Adaboost and Gradient Boosting and Voting Classifier were applied. Amongst all, Voting Classifier works the best with 96.95% accuracy followed by Gradient Boosting with Support Vector Classifier as the base estimator with 96.67% accuracy.
